This code can be used to replicate figures and the model from Tingley & Buzsaki 2018 (https://www.cell.com/neuron/abstract/S0896-6273(18)30336-2)

You'll need:

1) The data (link coming soon!)
2) Buzcode 
    `git clone https://github.com/buzsakilab/buzcode`
    (in matlab) `compileBuzcode.m`
3) Running any of the makeFig*.m files should generate a Matlab version of the figures from the paper
4) If you'd like to use/check out the model, go here (https://github.com/DavidTingley/papers/LS_phasecoding/modeling)
