This code can be used to replicate figures and the model from Tingley & Buzsaki 2018 (https://www.cell.com/neuron/abstract/S0896-6273(18)30336-2)

You will need:

1) The data (link coming soon!)
2) Buzcode 

    (in terminal) `git clone https://github.com/buzsakilab/buzcode` or [here](https://github.com/buzsakilab/buzcode)

    (in matlab) `compileBuzcode.m`

3) Running any of the makeFig*.m files should generate a Matlab version of the figures from the paper
4) If you'd like to use/check out the CA1/CA3/LS models, click here: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/DavidTingley/papers/master), or [here to install some things](https://github.com/DavidTingley/papers/tree/master/LS_phasecoding/modeling).
